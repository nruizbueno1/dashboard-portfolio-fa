Here are some of the PowerBI (PBI) dashboards that I have created. These were based on real client dashboards, but all confidential information has been omitted and changed. These dashboards were created for the marketing team.

- The Customer Analytics folder contains dashboard for various customer analytics, as well as Facebook ad/campaign attribution. They take a deeper look at New vs Returning customers, ROAS, Growth/Churn rates, and different cohorts of customers.
- The Financial Analytics folder contains dashboards that present various types of financial information, such as Profit/Loss statements, daily spending habits and how they compare to what has been budgeted, adjustment rates and how each client compares to the industry averages at the time, and more!
