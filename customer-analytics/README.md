These dashboard were created to review different customer metrics.
The first dashboard compares metrics such as ROAS, new customers and how much revenue was attributed to them, and broke down daily new customer sales vs marketing spend in a combo chart.
The second dashboard breaks down MoM churn and growth rates. This analysis takes it a step farther by providing the total number amount of clients, and the total amount that have 
churned/joined - not just percentages.
The final chart breaks out customers by which service they signed up for and shows the average bill per service MoM and breaks that out by year. 
This helps to see sales trends in different service offerings and help project revenue.
