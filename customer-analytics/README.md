These dashboards were created to review different customer metrics.

- The first dashboard compares metrics such as ROAS, new customers, and the revenue attributed to them. It also breaks down daily new customer sales versus marketing spend in a combo chart.
- The second dashboard breaks down month-over-month churn and growth rates. This analysis goes a step further by showing the total number of clients, as well as the total number that churned or joined — not just percentages.
- The final dashboard breaks out customers by the service they signed up for and shows the average bill per service month-over-month, broken out by year. This helps identify sales trends across service offerings and supports revenue projection.
