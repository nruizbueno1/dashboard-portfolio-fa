These dashboards were created to review different customer metrics. Client information has been ommitted.

- The first dashboard compares metrics such as ROAS, new customers, and the revenue attributed to them. It also breaks down daily new customer sales versus marketing spend in a combo chart.
- The second dashboard breaks down month-over-month churn and growth rates. This analysis goes a step further by showing the total number of clients, as well as the total number that churned or joined — not just percentages.
- The third dashboard breaks out customers by the service they signed up for and shows the average bill per service month-over-month, broken out by year. This helps identify sales trends across service offerings and supports revenue projection.
- The fourth dashboard was used to display the customer's journey from Shopify to Checkout Champ as well as to properly allocate sales to Facebook ad success. The blue boxes are used to hide client confidential information.
